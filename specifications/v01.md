This standard has a goal to make development of simple front-end applications easier. The standarfd is implemented as a JSON.

## Rules

### Root element Project

The root element is "project" and it contains sub-elements sections with additional types after hyfen. Example:

    {"project": [{"section-hero": "Hello LLM"}, {"section-features":"Feature DESCRIPTION"}]} 

### Sub-Element Section-

Every sub element starts with "Section-" and after hyfen there goes some keyword like "hero" or "features" which defines the nature of the section.
Currently it could be STRICTLY hero, features or others. The key "others" is used for all undefined sections or if the section meaning is neither hero nor features.
